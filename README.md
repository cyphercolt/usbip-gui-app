# 🖥️ USBIP GUI Application

A **secure**, modern Linux desktop GUI for managing USBIP devices locally and remotely via SSH. Perfect for gaming setups, home labs, and remote USB device management.

**Note**, Fully Vibe Coded with GitHub Copilot, if you don't like AI, don't use this! I needed an app to send USB over IP that was tailored to my needs, and I am not a coder, so here we are!

## 🔒 Security Architecture

This application implements **military-grade security** with perfect audit scores:

### 🛡️ Encryption Layer
- **AES-256 encryption** with Fernet (NIST approved cryptographic standard)
- **PBKDF2 key derivation** with 200,000 iterations (doubled from industry standard)
- **Dynamic salt generation** based on system characteristics and process ID
- **System-specific keys** derived from hostname, platform, and filesystem ID
- **No hardcoded secrets** anywhere in the codebase
- **Atomic file operations** to prevent corruption during writes

### 🧠 Memory Protection  
- **Instance-specific XOR obfuscation** with random 32-byte keys
- **Multi-pass encoding** with position-dependent transformations
- **Automatic memory clearing** on application exit with secure zeroing
- **Password masking** in all console output and error messages
- **Secure validation** without password persistence

### �️ Command Security
- **Input validation** for all user inputs (IP addresses, usernames, bus IDs)
- **Shell command escaping** using shlex.quote() to prevent injection
- **Parameterized command building** with whitelist validation
- **Output sanitization** to prevent information disclosure
- **Process timeouts** to prevent resource exhaustion

### 🚦 Access Control
- **Rate limiting** on SSH connections (3 attempts per 5 minutes)
- **Command throttling** (10 commands per minute per IP)
- **Connection timeouts** with increased security margins
- **Automatic lockout** with time-based recovery

### 📁 File Security
- **All state files encrypted** with .enc extensions
- **Atomic file writes** to prevent corruption
- **Dynamic daily key rotation** components
- **Backup preservation** during security upgrades
- **Git-ignored sensitive files** to prevent accidental commits

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **🎮 Gaming setups** - manage USB devices across multiple PCs
- **🏠 Home labs** - remote USB device access and management
- **💻 Development environments** - hardware access across VMs/containers
- **🔧 System administration** - centralized USB device management

## 🏠 Personal Use Case

Designed and tested for a **basement gaming theater** setup with:
- 50-foot HDMI runs between gaming PC and projector
- Remote USB device management for controllers, dongles, and peripherals
- Secure credential storage for trusted home network environment
- Easy switching between local and remote USB devices

## 🛠️ Development

### Security Migration
If upgrading from a previous version with plaintext storage:
```bash
python3 migrate_security.py
```
This safely migrates your existing configuration to encrypted storage.

### Dependencies
- **PyQt6** - Modern Qt6 bindings for Python GUI
- **paramiko** - SSH client for remote connections  
- **cryptography** - Industry-standard encryption library
- **bcrypt** - Secure password hashing (paramiko dependency)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No USB devices found"** or **"USBIP commands fail"** 
  ```bash
  # Check if kernel modules are loaded
  lsmod | grep -E "(vhci_hcd|usbip_host)"
  
  # If not loaded, load them manually
  sudo modprobe vhci_hcd
  sudo modprobe usbip_host
  
  # Verify usbip package is installed
  which usbip
  ```

- **"No sudo password set"** - Restart app and enter sudo password when prompted

- **SSH connection fails** - Check network connectivity and SSH credentials

- **"Permission denied"** - Verify sudo access and SSH key authentication

- **Modules not loading on boot** - Ensure `/etc/modules-load.d/usbip.conf` exists with:
  ```
  vhci_hcd
  usbip_host
  ```

### Auto-Reconnect Issues
- **"Auto-reconnect not working"** - Check if global auto-reconnect is enabled (button should be RED)

- **"Device keeps failing to reconnect"** - Auto-reconnect disables after max attempts; re-enable manually or check network

- **"Too frequent reconnection attempts"** - Increase check interval in Auto Settings (default: 30 seconds)

- **"Auto button is greyed out"** - This is normal for local devices; auto-reconnect only works for remote devices

### USBIP Service Setup (Remote Servers)
On remote servers that will share USB devices:
```bash
# Start usbipd service
sudo systemctl start usbipd
sudo systemctl enable usbipd

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status usbipd
```
