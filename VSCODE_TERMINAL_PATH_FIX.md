# VS Code Terminal PATH Issue with usbipd

## üîç Problem Description

The `usbipd` command works in Windows Terminal but not in VS Code's integrated terminal, even though it's properly installed.

**Error in VS Code Terminal:**
```
usbipd : The term 'usbipd' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
```

**Works in Windows Terminal:**
```
PS C:\Users\Cyphe> usbipd --help
usbipd-win 5.2.0
```

## üéØ Root Cause

VS Code's integrated terminal inherits the PATH environment variable from when VS Code was started. If `usbipd` was installed after VS Code was launched, the terminal won't see the updated PATH that includes `C:\Program Files\usbipd-win\`.

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Solution 1: Restart VS Code (Recommended)
The simplest solution is to **restart VS Code** completely:
1. Close VS Code
2. Reopen VS Code
3. The terminal will now have the updated PATH with usbipd

### Solution 2: Refresh PATH in Current Session
If you don't want to restart VS Code, refresh the PATH manually:

```powershell
# Update PATH for current session
$env:PATH = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine") + ";" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")

# Test usbipd
usbipd --version
```

### Solution 3: Use Full Path Temporarily
Use the full path to usbipd while troubleshooting:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\usbipd-win\usbipd.exe" --version
```

## üîß Verification Steps

After applying any solution, verify that usbipd is accessible:

```powershell
# Check if command is found
Get-Command usbipd

# Check version
usbipd --version

# List USB devices
usbipd list
```

Expected output format:
```
Connected:
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                          STATE
3-1    32ac:0002  HDMI Expansion Card, USB Input Device          Not shared
3-3    32ac:001c  Laptop Webcam Module (2nd Gen)                Not shared
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Application Updates

The USB/IP GUI application has been updated to handle this scenario robustly:

### Enhanced Detection
- **Multiple Command Attempts**: Tries various ways to find usbipd
- **Full Path Fallback**: Uses `"C:\Program Files\usbipd-win\usbipd.exe"` as fallback
- **Improved Error Messages**: Better feedback when usbipd is not accessible

### Updated Remote OS Detector
```python
commands_to_try = [
    'usbipd --version',
    '"C:\\Program Files\\usbipd-win\\usbipd.exe" --version',
    'where usbipd',
    'Get-Command usbipd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source'
]
```

### Improved Parser
The usbipd list parser now correctly handles the real output format:
- **Section-aware parsing**: Distinguishes between "Connected:" and "Persisted:" sections
- **Regex splitting**: Properly separates device names from states
- **Robust field extraction**: Handles varying device name lengths

## üöÄ Testing Results

After fixes:
- ‚úÖ **VS Code Terminal**: `usbipd --version` returns `5.2.0`
- ‚úÖ **Device Listing**: Correctly parses real usbipd output
- ‚úÖ **GUI Integration**: Service management dialog works properly
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform**: Maintains compatibility with Linux systems

## üìã Best Practices

### For Development
1. **Restart VS Code** after installing system-level tools
2. **Check PATH** when commands work in one terminal but not another
3. **Use Get-Command** to verify command availability in PowerShell

### For Users
1. **Run VS Code as Administrator** if managing usbipd service
2. **Install usbipd-win** before using Windows server features
3. **Verify installation** with `usbipd --version` before connecting

## üîÆ Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:
- Install development tools before starting VS Code
- Use Windows Terminal for system administration tasks
- Consider using VS Code's "Terminal: Reload Window" command when PATH changes

The application now gracefully handles PATH issues and provides clear error messages when usbipd is not accessible, making the user experience much more robust.
